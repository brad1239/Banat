The tension was growing as the austro-hungarian empire was preparing to annex bosnia and the balkan nations prepard to liberate themself from the tirrany of the ottoman empire but waited for a moment of weakness, so they did it in 1912, after the the ottoman-italian war they united and formed 1 big aliance named the balkan league and so they defeted the ottomans in 1913. But bulgaria took more teritory than they belived they would get but they did not strike they were preparing for the war. 
But they were to late in the sumer of 1914 Gavrilo shot the Arkduke Franz Ferdinand so the war began, Serbia did not declare war on Bulgaria as it was Defending the north border,so Bulgaria, Greece and albania remained neutral for the rest of the war, but in 1915 italy and romania joined the war believing they would retake their teritories from the austrians but they ultimateley wrong. In 1917 the Bolshevik revolution broke out but failed. By then Germany, Britain, France and Russia were runing low on manpower so they had truce.
